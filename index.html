    <h1>Soda's Yuri Recommendation List</h1> 
    <h3>This is my awesome yuri recommendation list. It will include comics and shows ranging from general girl love to of course yuri. I will also include a few that are not yuri but feature emotionally intimate female dynamics, making them yuri adjascent (like nana). I love toxic yuri and doomed yuri. No smut except for one because the plot was really good.</h3>
    <ul> 
        <li>Love Bullet (Manga, ongoing, wholesome)</li>
        <li>A Monster Wants to Eat Me (Manga, completed, doomed)</li>
        <li>I Love Amy (Webcomic, completed, toxic, slice of life, comedy, tsundere)</li>
